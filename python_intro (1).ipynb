        "\n",
        "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.Python is simple and easier to learn. It puts emphasis on readability, and thereby lowers the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which allows for program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the vast standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms and can be freely distributed.\n",
